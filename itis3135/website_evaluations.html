            <h3>C.R.A.P Design Principles</h3>
            <ul style="max-width: 70%;">
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong><br>involves highlighting the differences between elements in a design to create visual interest and emphasize important information. This can be achieved through variations in color, size, shape, or typography. Contrast helps important elements stand out and grabs the viewer's attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Repitition</strong><br>involves using consistent design elements, such as colors, fonts, or shapes, throughout a design to create unity and cohesion. Repetition helps to establish a sense of consistency and familiarity, making the design more organized and easier to understand.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong><br>refers to the arrangement of elements along a common axis or edge. Proper alignment ensures that elements are visually connected and create a harmonious layout. Aligning text, images, and other design elements helps maintain order and readability in a design.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong><br>also known as grouping, this is the principle of placing related elements close together. By grouping related content or objects, you create a clear visual hierarchy and help the viewer understand the relationships between different elements in the design. Proximity simplifies complex information and enhances overall readability.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://www.wired.com/" target="_blank">Good Website</a></h3>
                <p>Wired.com is an online news platform focused on "the latest in technology, science, culture and business."</p>
                <ul style="max-width: 70%;">
                    <li><strong>Contrast</strong><br>This website shows good contrast despite having a plain white background. It is clear to see where each article is and is not, as well as what is the whitespace. Articles of different sizes as well help visually break up the page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition</strong><br>I could find no examples of stylistic inconsistencies in this page. Matching fonts and shapes across the page allow easy distinction between different items as well as purposefully breaking this symmetry. One break in the page has a colorful design behind it, directing a lot of attention to their newsletter signup. </li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment</strong><br>Page alignment is consistent across all parts. The header, main body, and footer all have consistent edges and proper margins. There is little whitespace wasted on any part of this webpage. </li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity</strong><br>As this is a news website, the proximity of the news articles resembles a newspaper to some degree. Little padding and small margins on many of them make a tight page allowing the front page to host a massive amount of content. Despite being tight knit, the entire page is well readable.</li>
                </ul>   
                <p></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Bad Website</a></h3>
                <p>The Yale school of art website is an ever evolving page that functions as a collaborative project for students. Any art student is allowed to edit and add to the website.</p>
                <ul style="max-width: 70%;">
                    <li><strong>Contrast</strong><br>This website has plenty of contrast, too much contrast in fact. So much contrast that it's impossible to determine different categories and the importance of different items. And forget looking for something specific without the search feature.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition</strong><br>There is little to no repetition on this page. Nearly every different section has a different font and colors and the shapes of all of them are different as well. It's clear that each part was made individually with no regard for the others on the page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment</strong><br>At the moment of writing this, the entire right side of the page is empty, some sections overlap others, and random text covers other information. What more can I say?</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity</strong><br>Like with alignment, many elements overlap others and are not cleanly positioned in relation to nearby elements. Some elements have different widths than others while others are too far apart.</li>
                </ul>
