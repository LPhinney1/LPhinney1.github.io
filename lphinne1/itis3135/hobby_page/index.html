            <h1>About the IS</h1>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The 1st generation Lexus IS300, originally known as the Toyota Altezza in Japan, made its debut in the United States in the year 2000. This was a significant moment for Lexus, Toyota's luxury division, as it sought to establish a strong foothold in the compact luxury sedan market. The Altezza, which was well-received in Japan, underwent some modifications and rebranding before being introduced as the Lexus IS300 in North America. With its sleek design and compact yet sporty profile, the IS300 brought a fresh and stylish alternative to the American market, competing with established European luxury brands.</p>

            </figure>
            <h2>Reviews</h2>
            <p>Reviewers at the time enjoyed the 1st generation Lexus IS300 for its distinctive character and engaging driving dynamics. In a segment dominated by German rivals like the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the IS300 stood out with its Japanese precision and reliability. The responsive inline-six engine, smooth automatic transmission, and rear-wheel-drive configuration offered a balanced and sporty driving experience. Critics praised its nimble handling and well-tuned suspension, making it a viable contender among luxury compact sedans. The interior was also well-received, offering a comfortable and high-quality cabin, though some noted a bit less rear-seat space compared to its competitors.</p>

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>The 1st generation Lexus IS300 was available with a range of options and powertrain choices to suit various preferences. It was equipped with a 3.0-liter inline-six engine known as the 2JZ-GE, which produced 215 horsepower and was mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. Enthusiasts could also opt for the manual transmission variant. The 2JZ-GE engine shared its heritage with the legendary powerplant found in the Toyota Supra, lending the IS300 an extra dose of performance credibility. Additionally, Lexus offered sportier variants, such as the IS300 SportCross, a wagon model, catering to buyers who desired a blend of versatility and performance. Overall, the 1st generation Lexus IS300 provided a compelling package of style, performance, and customization options in the competitive compact luxury sedan market.</p>

            <h1>Maintenance</h1>
            <p>This list is a compilation of some of the most common problems on these cars as they age. Common fixes and part codes can be found on many forum posts and YouTube. These cars are very strong, with the proper preventative maintenance they can easily go over 300,000 miles and beyond. Look out for these common failure points!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Bushings, Bearings and Gaskets</h3></li>
                <p>Rubber! Replacing worn rubber components is essential for sustaining safety, performance, and reliability, as these elements deteriorate over time especially so when oil leaks onto them.</p>
                <li><h3>Electrical Gremlins</h3></li>
                <p>Bulbs burning out, fuses blowing, and wires being mysteriously worn or chewed through. All of these issues can be hard to track down but essential to keeping your car on the road.</p>
                <li><h3>E-Shift Woes</h3></li>
                <p>The automatic transmission is harsh-shifting. Especially from gears 1-2 when the fluid is cold, but then is smooth as butter. Changing transmission fluid frequently can help mitigate the issue.</p>
                <li><h3>Air Conditioning</h3></li>
                <p>Especially in hotter climates, The A/C systems on these cars are all but guaranteed to fail at some point. Hoses and connection points are more and more likely to fail with age.</p>
                <li><h3>Sticky Dash</h3></li>
                <p>The bane of many IS owners existence... On all years except 2001, the coating applied to the dashboard melts in the heat and becomes very gummy and sticky to the touch.</p>
                <li><h3>Preventative Maintenance Tips</h3></li>
                <p>Ensuring the longevity of your car requires proactive measures. Consider the following preventative maintenance tips:</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Logan Phinney and I am currently 20 years of age and a junior at UNC Charlotte. I was born and raised just a stones throw away in Cary, NC. I was immediately addicted to driving as soon as I got my permit and wanted to learn everything I could about cars. After a year of driving a bright blue, grandma spec Civic, I got the IS300 and have put nearly 40,000 miles on it since. Although it has had its fair share of problems, as I could expect for a car as old as myself, it's treated me well and never left me stranded on road trips.</p>
            <p>The reason that I decided on an IS300 is mainly because the reliability. My family all drives Hondas so growing up all I heard about was how unreliable German and American cars are. I had to break the Honda trend so whats the next best thing? Toyota. After driving a Civic for over a year, I needed something rear-wheel drive and I fell in love with the styling of the IS. After all the miles, I think it's safe to say I made the right choice.</p>
