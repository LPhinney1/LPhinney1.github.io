            <h2>Project 1</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This webpage serves as the hub for the BLNC brand. This is not a shop page, rather it's the artistic hub for BLNCs creators to showcase their work and stay connected with their community. My goal for this project is to make it easy for them to continuously update the page and maintain it without me, even with their limited web development knowledge.</p>
            <p>The intended users of this website are mainly BLNCs community focused around clothing, other lifestyle interests, and the creators themselves. Users discovering the brand and website for the first time are also central to the design.</p>
            <p>The website will feature an image gallery, meet the creators page, mission statement, news section, and contact page. In addition, links to BLNCs social media and other projects will be included in the footer.</p>
