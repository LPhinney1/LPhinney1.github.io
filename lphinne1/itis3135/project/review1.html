                <h3>Checklist</h3>         
                <li><strong>Your submission leads right to the page to be reviewed (or if instructed the primary page with links to the page, or both)</strong></li>
                <p>All links function correctly however the location of this project is incorrect. The project overview page should stand alone from the rest of the project.</p>
                <li><strong>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc..</strong></li>
                <p>File names are appropriate and do not use any bad characters. Image names as well are concise and descriptive.</p>
                <li><strong>General cleanliness of code</strong></li>
                <p>Code is clean and easily understandable. Indenting and spacing properly seperates sections.</p>
                <li><strong>HTML / CSS verification</strong></li>
                <p>Verification buttons in footer are broken and do not link to proper page.</p>
                <h4>CRAP Principles</h4>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong></li>
                <p>Contrast is very poor causing bad visibility. Dark text color on dark background makes it hard to read at any brightness. Changing text color to white would be one easy fix. On the product and shop pages, the pink background stands out too much against the darker green colors as well.</p>
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong></li>
                <p>Repetition of the pages is very good, they all use the same CSS file as as such there is no inconsistency in the elements.</p>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong></li>
                <p>There is a typo in the title element of the account page (">") causing the header to be placed slightly lower. Apart from that, the general alignment of the page is good and consistent.</p>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong></li>
                <p>The accounts page needs some spacing on the text inputs and buttons. Shop and products pages need images resized (using max-height: or resizing actual images)</p>
                <h4>Main</h4>
                <li><strong>Layout includes header, footer, main, id and class tags. Consistency of layout across pages. Appropriate content on the home page including images.</strong></li>
                <p>Pages include all needed elements and remain relatively consistent and some clever use of class tags.</p>
                <li><strong>Link to all 4 mandatory pages and links work on all the pages. Bar is consistent position across pages.</strong></li>
                <p>Page has correct number of subpages and the nav bar does remain consistent. Links are correct and work from any other section of the page.</p>
                <li><strong>Appropriate content on each page including images.</strong></li>
                <p>There is the appropriate content on each page however some of them feel sparse. The about us page for example could use at least some images to spruce it up.</p>
