                <h3>Checklist</h3>
                <li><strong>Your submission leads right to the page to be reviewed (or if instructed the primary page with links to the page, or both)</strong></li>
                <p>The nav link contained in the itis3135 folder does not link to the client project. I had to use github to manually find the path to the project however once on that page, the new nav links worked as intended.</p>
                <li><strong>There are no spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc..</strong></li>
                <p>All file names are appropriate and descriptive, including image files.</p>
                <li><strong>General cleanliness of code</strong></li>
                <p>Code is easily readable and has clean indentation and spacing.</p> 
                <li><strong>HTML / CSS verification</strong></li>
                <p>All pages successfully verify.</p>
                <h4>CRAP Principles</h4>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong></li>
                <p>The contrast of this page is good. Header text sstand out the most as it should as well as borders for the header and footer. The body text should be a more neutral color in order to improve readability of larger blocks of text. Links do a good job standing out as well.</p>
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong></li>
                <p>The repetition of the project page is very good. All pages use a shared .css file in order to maintain styling. The 'leave a comment' box at the bottom of all pages should be added to the footer if it is a common element across all pages.</p>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong></li>
                <p>One thing about the alignment that could be improved is the header and footer in relation to main. The main body does not contain any borders, creating the effect of all elements floating in an empty space. Adding a main border or removing margins from the other borders may help.</p>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong></li>
                <p>The general proximity of most elements across these pages are very good, everything feels natural and it's not a strain to discern different elements. One note to add to that would be the images and comment box, images and the comment box have no margins where some is needed.</p>
                <h4>Main</h4>
                <li><strong>Layout includes header, footer, main, id and class tags. Consistency of layout across pages. Appropriate content on the home page including images.</strong></li>
                <p>Header and footer remain consistent using HTMLInclude and elements have class tages as needed. Styling of pages remains consistent as well as home page.</p>
                <li><strong>Link to all 4 mandatory pages and links work on all the pages. Bar is consistent position across pages.</strong></li>
                <p>All required page links are working and nav bar remains consistent.</p>
                <li><strong>Appropriate content on each page including images.</strong></li>
                <p>All pages are filled and contain their needed content and images.</p>
